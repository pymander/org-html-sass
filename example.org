   What follows is a blockquote. What you are reading now is some sample text so you can view the offset.

   #+begin_quote
   “I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy hammer. Oh! ye three
   unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel; and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and
   haughty helm, and Pole-pointed prow,—death-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and without me? Am
   I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely
   life! Oh, now I feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your
   furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone life, and top this one
   piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the
   last I grapple with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my last breath
   at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool! and since neither can be mine, let
   me then tow to pieces, while still chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! Thus, I
   give up the spear!”

** Verse

   Now I'm going to quote Shakespeare, because why not?

   #+begin_verse
   What's he that wishes so?
   My cousin, Westmorland? No, my fair cousin;
   If we are mark'd to die, we are enough
   To do our country loss; and if to live,
   The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
   God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
   By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
   Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
   It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
   Such outward things dwell not in my desires.
   But if it be a sin to covet honour,
   I am the most offending soul alive.
   No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.
   God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour
   As one man more methinks would share from me
   For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
   Rather proclaim it, Westmorland, through my host,
   That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
   Let him depart; his passport shall be made,
   And crowns for convoy put into his purse;
   We would not die in that man's company
   That fears his fellowship to die with us.
   This day is call'd the feast of Crispian.
   He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
   Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,
   And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
   He that shall live this day, and see old age,
   Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
   And say "To-morrow is Saint Crispian."
   Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,
   And say "These wounds I had on Crispin's day."
   Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,
   But he'll remember, with advantages,
   What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,
   Familiar in his mouth as household words—
   Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,
   Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester—
   Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red.
   This story shall the good man teach his son;
   And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
   From this day to the ending of the world,
   But we in it shall be rememberèd—
   We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
   For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
   Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
   This day shall gentle his condition;
   And gentlemen in England now a-bed
   Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,
   And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
   That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.
